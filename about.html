            <h1>About Anchan Thai</h1>
            <p>The owner and head chef, Patchara, known as Annie to her friends, started learning to cook traditional Thai cuisine
                more than 30 years ago from her grandmother in Loei province, in the northeast of Thailand near Wang Saphung. Before
                leaving her home country she owned and operated her own restaurant in Khon Kaen for over 5 years.
            
                She also was a chef in Shanghai for four years as well as in many restaurants in Colorado in recent years. She has
                permanently resided in Colorado since 2009. She now continues her passion for cooking in her new venture, Achan
                Thai. Patchara has been vegetarian for most of her life and became vegan in 2015.</p>
